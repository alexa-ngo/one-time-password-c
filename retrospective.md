# Project: Encryption and Decryption for Client and Server

## What happened and what I learned:

- good and nice code is concise and not frustrating to read
- leverage reusable code such as functions
- the main function should act as the runner
- create components that does one job well

## What I didn't understand:

- know and understand the required behavior and specification of both the client and the server depending on the protocol
- spend the time to write clean code because in the long run it will actually save time
- code should be pleasant to work with and not "spaghetti" code

## What I can do better?

- understand and be able to verbally retell the problem concisely
- design and confirm the idea before even coding
- work in smaller steps and be even more detailed to get to the goal
- write better comments to not waste time for my future self
- be able to explain and justify why i am doing each step and why it is the better idea

## What to change to improve?
- understand the purpose and real problem
- be detailed 
- the code should be easy to review and make sense to others
- make a new branch for each changed behavior for easy PR reviews
- know how to use git better

## What went well?
- coding in C was not as difficult as it used to be

## What could be improved/failed?
- understand the problem
- stop to think and plan to prevent rework
- write more detailed instructions of how to use the program
